# SHORT TUTORIAL ON GIT AND GITHUB FOR THE BUSY PROGRAMMER
In the world of software development, people use version control systems to keep track of their source code.<br>
Whether you are a software engineer or just working in any IT related fields this tutorial is for you.<br>
First things first, in an endeavor to version control your code you will need a hosting server in this case GitHub(we have others).<br>
Next you will need to install Git on your machine. Git will help you to communicate with your hosting server.<br>
<br>
To sign up for a free github account please visit : https://github.com/join <br>
To install Git visit : https://git-scm.com/downloads <br><br>
Now that you have an account with Github and you have Git installed on your machine, we can begin.<br><br>
When we host our code files on GitHub, there are hosted in a special directory called a repository<br><br>
To create your first repositoy on Github just log in and then on your right you will see a + symbol,<br><br>
 click on it and it will give you an option to craete a new repository, just give it a name and you can leave other options with the defaults.<br><br>
 Just one thing to remember is that this repository is hosted on the server not on your machine.<br><br>
 To have a copy on your machine that you will be working with, you have to clone this repository.<br><br>
 To clone a repositoy, just open your Git app and then type git clone repository URL <br><br>
 To get the url of any repository just open that repository and on your right you will see an option called code,<br><br>
 click on it and then click the save icon as shown in this image <br><br>![](C:\Users\user\Desktop\git learn.png)<br>
